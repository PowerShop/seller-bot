# How to implement

You can create new embeds by using the `EmbedBuilder` class.

You can also use the function I just wrote, that is sendEmbed() in Folder `functions/sendEmbed.js`

And how to use function, see in file.

If you choose to create an `embed` instead of using the `function` of my bot, you follow this method.

- Create embed file with your name whatever you want like: `hello.js`
- Import `EmbedBuilder` class from `discord.js`
- See `welcomeMessage.js`
- Import them in anywhere
